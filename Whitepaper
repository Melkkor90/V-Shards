Shards (SHRDS) Whitepaper
1. Executive Summary

Project Name: Shards
Developed by: Group Akira

1. Introduction to Shards
The name Shards was chosen to encapsulate the essence of this unique cryptocurrency project. Each Shard represents a fragment of a whole, reflecting our commitment to building a diversified and valuable collection of assets. The project begins with a foundation in collectible Pokémon cards, which are then backed by “safe haven” assets, including gold and also Bitcoin.
This concept ensures that each Shard not only holds intrinsic value but is also a piece of a broader, ever-expanding collection. As the project grows, the value of each Shard is poised to increase, offering investors a tangible, appreciating asset that is part of something greater.
By choosing the name Shards, we emphasize the project’s commitment to creating value through carefully curated and diversified assets, appealing to collectors, investors, and those who seek a stable and growing store of value in the cryptocurrency space.

Shards (symbol: shrds), commonly referred to as shards, is a unique cryptocurrency backed by a collection of art and collectible items with an initial value of $500. The project aims to provide a secure and transparent way to invest in valuable art and collectibles without needing to own the physical assets. shards operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to leverage low fees and fast transaction execution.
2. Mission and Vision
Mission: Our mission is to democratize access to investments in valuable art and collectibles, allowing anyone to acquire and trade fractions of these assets through shards.
Vision: We strive to create a platform where collectors and enthusiasts can invest in shards, digital tokens backed by physical assets that not only preserve but also increase in value over time.
3. Coin Structure
	•	Token Name: Shards
	•	Symbol: SHRDS
	•	Total Token Supply: 1,000,000 SHRDS
	•	Initial Circulating Supply: 800,000 SHRDS
	•	Reserved Tokens (20%): 200,000 SHRDS
4. Use of Funds
	•	Initial Liquidity: $500 will be allocated to the Liquidity Pool on PancakeSwap on BSC, pairing 800,000 Templars with $500 in BUSD.
	•	Reinvestment in the Collection: A 2.5% tax will be applied to each Templar transaction. This tax will be exclusively used to reinvest in the art and collectible collection backing TemplarCoin, increasing its value over time.
5. Key Features of Shards
5.1 Backed by Physical Assets
shards is backed by a physical collection of art and collectibles with an initial value of $500. This collection will be regularly assessed and updated to reflect its current market value, ensuring that each “shards” is backed by a tangible asset.
5.2 Liquidity Pool
The initial Liquidity Pool will be established on PancakeSwap (BSC) with $500 in BUSD and 800,000 shards. This ensures that investors can easily buy and sell Shards with minimal initial volatility.
5.3 2.5% Transaction Tax
Each transaction involving Shards will have a 2.5% tax. These funds will be used to expand and enhance the collection of assets backing Shards, helping to increase the token’s value over time. This approach ensures sustainable and continuous growth for the project.
5.4 Community and Transparency
We are committed to maintaining open and transparent communication with our community. All significant actions, such as acquiring new assets for the collection, expanding the Liquidity Pool, and project updates, will be publicly announced.

7. Conclusion
Shards is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s an opportunity to invest in art and collectibles with tangible backing. With a focus on transparency, sustainability, and community, Shards is designed to grow 

Asset Composition
The Shards project is backed by a diversified portfolio comprising:
	•	80% Pokémon Cards: A collection of carefully selected Pokémon cards, primarily from the 151 set, which are expected to appreciate in value over time due to their nostalgic appeal, rarity, and market demand.
	•	20% Gold Coins: A reserve of gold coins, valued at 20% of the total asset portfolio, to provide stability and a hedge against market downturns.
Gold Reserve Strategy
	•	Purpose: The gold reserve serves as a strategic buffer against extreme volatility in the Pokémon card market. By holding gold coins as part of the project’s backing, we aim to ensure the long-term stability and resilience of Shards.
	•	Type of Gold Assets: The gold reserve will consist of recognized gold coins, such as the 2023 Great Britain 1/10 oz Gold Britannia or Gold Francs. These coins are chosen for their liquidity, stability, and universal recognition.
Threshold for Declaring Gold Reserve
	•	20% Volatility Threshold: The value of the gold reserve will be “declared” and potentially utilized if the value of the Pokémon card collection drops by 20% from its initial valuation. This threshold ensures that the gold is only used in meaningful downturns, providing a clear and strategic response to market volatility.
	•	Example Scenario: If the initial value of the Pokémon card collection is $500, and it drops by 20% ($100), bringing the value down to $400, the gold reserve will be declared. The presence of gold assets, valued at $300, can then be communicated to investors to stabilize confidence and demonstrate that the project’s overall value remains strong.
Personal Bitcoin Wallet as a Declared Asset
	•	Emergency Declaration: In the event that the gold reserve is not sufficient to cover significant depreciation in the value of the Pokémon cards, the project’s creator will declare their personal Bitcoin wallet as an additional asset. This wallet is intended to serve as a further layer of security and stability during prolonged bear markets or extreme market conditions.
	•	Not Intended for Immediate Use: It is important to note that declaring the Bitcoin wallet as an asset does not imply that it will be used or liquidated. The wallet is declared purely to provide reassurance to investors that additional assets back the project. The Bitcoin wallet is there to ensure the project remains well-supported, even if the gold reserve alone cannot maintain the value of the initial investments.
	•	Communication Strategy: If the Bitcoin wallet is declared, investors will be informed transparently about the wallet’s value and its role in supporting the project during emergencies. This declaration is a proactive measure to maintain investor confidence, without necessitating any immediate action.

Operational Flexibility
	•	Gold Reserve as a Backup: The gold reserve is maintained separately from the primary liquidity pool and is not included in day-to-day operations. It is specifically reserved for use during significant market downturns, ensuring that it remains available to counteract volatility when it matters most.
	•	Liquidity Pool: The liquidity pool will primarily reflect the value of the Pokémon card assets, ensuring transparency and simplicity in the daily valuation of Shards. The gold reserve serves as an emergency fund, activated only when the 20% threshold is met.
Investor Transparency
	•	Decentralized Ledger Reporting: The value of the gold reserve will be documented and updated on decentralized ledgers, providing full transparency to investors without affecting the liquidity pool. This approach allows for clear communication about the project’s financial health while maintaining the integrity of the liquidity pool.
	•	Regular Updates: Investors will receive regular updates on the value of the Pokémon card collection and the status of the gold reserve. This transparency ensures that all stakeholders are informed and confident in the project’s management.
Market Potential and Projections
Pokémon Cards
	•	Growth Potential: The 151 set Pokémon cards are expected to appreciate in value due to their strong nostalgic appeal and market demand. Historical trends suggest that well-preserved and graded cards from this set could see significant growth over the next 5-15 years.
	•	Volatility Management: While the Pokémon card market offers high growth potential, it is also subject to volatility. The inclusion of a gold reserve ensures that Shards can weather market downturns and continue to provide value to investors.
Gold Coins
	•	Stability and Security: Gold has long been considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. By including gold coins in the project’s backing, Shards provides a level of security that many other collectible-backed tokens lack.
	•	Emergency Use: The gold reserve is specifically designed to be used during periods of extreme volatility, ensuring that the project remains stable even in challenging market conditions.

Conclusion
Shards represents a unique blend of high-growth potential and stability, offering investors a balanced approach to asset-backed cryptocurrency. By combining the speculative appeal of Pokémon cards with the time-tested stability of gold, Shards is positioned to offer significant returns while protecting against market volatility.
With a clear strategy for managing risk and a commitment to transparency, Shards aims to build long-term value for its investors. Whether you’re drawn to the nostalgic appeal of Pokémon cards or the stability of gold, Shards offers a compelling investment opportunity.

Preventing Centralization and Price Crashes
	•	10% Holding Limit: To avoid centralization and prevent any single entity from crashing the price of Shards, no investor will be allowed to buy or hold more than 10% of the total coin supply. This measure is designed to ensure a decentralized and stable market, reducing the risk of manipulation and maintaining the coin’s value.
	•	Fair Distribution: The distribution of Shards will be carefully monitored to ensure fairness and prevent any concentration of power among a few investors. This approach supports the long-term health and stability of the project.
Measures to Prevent Rug Pulls
	•	Transparency and Accountability: Shards is committed to complete transparency in all operations, including asset holdings, transaction history, and the management of reserves. All significant decisions and financial activities will be documented on decentralized ledgers, accessible to all investors.
	•	Locked Liquidity: To prevent rug pulls, a significant portion of the liquidity will be locked for a predetermined period, ensuring that the funds are secure and cannot be withdrawn or misused by the project’s creators.
	•	Community Governance: Key decisions regarding the project’s future, including the use of reserves or changes to the liquidity pool, will be subject to community governance. This ensures that the project remains aligned with the interests of its investors and reduces the risk of unilateral actions that could harm the project’s stability.

Shards Release Strategy
	•	Initial Lock-Up: The project’s creator will initially lock up 200,000 Shards, ensuring that these coins are not available for immediate sale or trading. This lock-up period is designed to prevent large-scale sell-offs that could destabilize the market in the early stages of the project.
	•	Gradual Release: The locked Shards will be released gradually in controlled increments, allowing the market to absorb the supply without causing price disruptions. This release strategy will be carefully timed and managed, with each release contingent upon reaching specific project milestones or achieving certain market conditions.
	•	Community Involvement: The release of Shards will be communicated transparently to the community, with input from investors and stakeholders considered in the timing and size of each release. This approach ensures that the interests of the community are aligned with the project’s long-term success.
